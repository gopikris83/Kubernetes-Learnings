Kube Master not ready status Fix
-----------------------------------
You need install a Network Policy Provider, this is one of supported provider: Weave Net for NetworkPolicy. command line to install:

Command: kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"

After a few seconds, a Weave Net pod should be running on each Node and any further pods you create will be automatically attached to the Weave network


Kubernetes kubeadm init issue resolution
----------------------------------------

Follow the Kubernetes instructions to install kubeadm

Note: After installing kubeadm, do not power down or restart the host. Instead, continue directly to the next step.

As a regular user with sudo privileges, open a terminal on the host that you installed kubeadm on.

Initialize the master using the following command.

sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
Note: If 192.168.0.0/16 is already in use within your network you must select a different pod network CIDR, replacing 192.168.0.0/16 in the above command.

Execute the following commands to configure kubectl (also returned by kubeadm init).

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config


Kubectl get nodes error
----------------------
Error: Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "kubernetes")

Using kubectl Exec command - Error: unable to upgrade connection: pod does not exist
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reason: Master node could not establish connection with worker nodes effectively. It searches for the pods in worker node and fails. 

1.Steps: Check the locations of the pods placed in worker nodes 
Command: kubectl get pod -o=custom-columns=NODE:.spec.nodeName,NAME:.metadata.name --all-namespaces

2. Update the 10-kubeadm.conf file by adding "Environment=" for the line "KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--node-ip=<IP ADDRESS>
File Location: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf

Save the file and exit!
Command: systemctl daemon-reload
Command: systemctl restart kubelet
Command: kubectl get nodes -o wide , Now you'll see the ip of worker1 has changed.

Now, use the exec command from Master node which should work perfectly well!
